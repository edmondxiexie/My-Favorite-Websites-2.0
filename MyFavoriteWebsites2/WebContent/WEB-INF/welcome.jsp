<h1>Welcome To Favorites.com</h1>
<span> Welcome to the demo website for my J2EE Web Application project. 
	This website is a place for users to manage their favorite websites and also 
	share these websites with others.
</span>
<br />
<br />
<span> You can also browse the lists of others' favorite websites by clicking 
	the user name in the navigation bar on the left. You can choose All User, 
	or just one specific user.
</span>
<br />
<br />
<span> For testing purpose, the website has already genarated two dummy users 
	called Barack Obama and Donald Trump when first time launched. You can 
	have a sight about their favorite websites in the list.
</span>

<span>This project is from course J2EE Web Application Development(08-672), 
	Carnegie Mellon University, directed by Professor Jeff L. Eppinger.
